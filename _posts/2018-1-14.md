# 2018-1-14
- In the past week, I was struggling with creating a cart-pole simulation environment for reinforcement learning. I was stucked at reseting the simulation for a while, then figured out that publishing topic of `/gazebo/set_link_state` seemed a good solution. Details can be seen at [my project repository!](https://github.com/linZHank/invpend_experiment).
- ICRA replied their decision on my draft submission, unfortunately, my paper was declined. It seemed too many people were submitting their work resulted in overload to the reviewers. One of two reviewers of my paper did not get my point, though the other one made valuable suggestions. I would like to respond to every comment they gave, and try IROS later.
