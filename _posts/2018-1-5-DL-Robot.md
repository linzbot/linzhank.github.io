# Big Picture
* *Initialize: Build a simulation environment with an inverted pendulum in gazebo*
  - [x] Create inverted pendulum model using URDF, and visualize the model in rviz
  - [x] Spawn the inverted pendulum in gazebo
  - [ ] Move the inverted pendulum through ROS
  - [ ] Generate state, action, reward, etc., from simulation
  - [ ] Implement deep reinforcement learning to control the inverted pendulum
* *Build simulation environment with model of the robot in gazebo*
* *Simulated robot learns to catch with real human data feed*
* *Ultimate goal: The robot catches the ball thrown by human*
